# Generation of GTFS feeds

This project contains scripts that allows publicly available timetables and other information about transit routes to be transformed into a [GTFS Schedule](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/) feed. The nature of this task, which is to standardize data means that the code has to be basically custom for all transit agencies that provide their data in a different manner.
